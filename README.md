	1. Find which month got the highest Sales and Orders		
  
	2. Compare the sales and orders using single chart

	4. Order Status
  
	5. Top 10 states contributing to the sales
  
	6. Relation between Age and Gender based on number of orders
  
	7. How much each channel contributes to the sales
  
	8. Highest Selling Categories
 
  and many more can be observed.
