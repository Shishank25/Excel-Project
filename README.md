# Excel-Project
A project on Microsoft Excel which utilizes pivot tables to display information in a manner which is easy to understand and adjust/filter with the help of slicers.

  Find which month got the highest Sales and Orders								
  Compare the sales and orders using single chart								
  Who makes purcheses more often: Men or Women
  Order Status
  Top 10 states contributing to the sales
  Relation between Age and Gender based on number of orders
